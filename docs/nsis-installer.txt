Building NSIS installer for using bzr-xmloutput with standalone bzr.exe
==============================================================

To build NSIS installer you need NSIS program itself.

To build installer you need to run command from tree root::

	python setup.py bdist_nsis

NSIS is able to run on Linux platform, so in theory this command should
work even on Linux.

Resulting installer will appear in tree root with name
``bzr-xmloutput-setup-X.Y.Z.exe``.


SimpleXMLRPCServer (mandatory)
*****************
SimpleXMLRPCServer.py should be placed in ``./installer/_lib`` directory.
Usually you can copy them from your Python 2.5 ``site-packages``
directory.
